# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-03-foundation-core-recipe-discovery/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-03
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Next.js 14+ with App Router**: TypeScript-enabled application with strict type checking and modern routing
- **Supabase Integration**: Authentication, PostgreSQL database, and real-time capabilities setup
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using TailwindCSS with breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Performance**: Initial page load under 3 seconds, recipe listing pagination with 20 items per page
- **Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) for user data, secure authentication flows, and proper CORS configuration
- **SEO Optimization**: Server-side rendering for recipe pages, proper meta tags, and structured data markup
- **Recipe Scraping**: Rate-limited scraping (max 1 request per second per domain) with proper user-agent headers
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries, graceful fallbacks, and user-friendly error messages
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## Approach Options

**Option A: Static Generation with ISR**
- Pros: Excellent performance, SEO-friendly, reduced database load
- Cons: Recipe updates have delay, more complex build process

**Option B: Server-Side Rendering with Caching** (Selected)
- Pros: Real-time data, simpler architecture, better for user-generated content preparation
- Cons: Higher server load, requires proper caching strategy

**Option C: Client-Side Rendering with API Routes**
- Pros: Simpler initial setup, familiar SPA patterns
- Cons: Poor SEO, slower initial load, not optimal for recipe discovery

**Rationale:** Option B provides the best balance of performance and real-time capabilities while maintaining excellent SEO for recipe discovery. The caching strategy will mitigate server load concerns.

## External Dependencies

- **@supabase/supabase-js** - Official Supabase client for authentication and database operations
- **Justification:** Required for Supabase integration, well-maintained official library

- **@tanstack/react-query** - Server state management and caching
- **Justification:** Excellent caching and synchronization with Supabase real-time features

- **react-hook-form** - Form handling and validation
- **Justification:** Minimal re-renders, excellent TypeScript support, integrates well with Zod

- **zod** - Schema validation for forms and API responses
- **Justification:** TypeScript-first validation, pairs perfectly with React Hook Form

- **cheerio** - Server-side HTML parsing for recipe scraping
- **Justification:** jQuery-like server-side DOM manipulation, essential for scraping

- **puppeteer** - Headless browser for JavaScript-heavy recipe sites
- **Justification:** Some recipe sites require JavaScript execution, fallback for complex scraping

- **@phosphor-icons/react** - Icon library for UI components
- **Justification:** Consistent with tech stack, excellent variety and performance

- **date-fns** - Date manipulation for recipe timestamps and formatting
- **Justification:** Lightweight alternative to moment.js, tree-shakable

## Architecture Patterns

**Database Design**: Single-table inheritance for recipes with JSONB columns for flexible ingredient storage and source-specific metadata

**Scraping Strategy**: Queue-based processing with retry logic, storing raw HTML and parsed data separately for debugging and re-processing capabilities

**Authentication Flow**: Server-side session management with Supabase Auth, protected API routes, and client-side state management with React Query

**Component Structure**: Atomic design principles with reusable UI components, feature-based organization, and clear separation between presentation and business logic

**Error Boundaries**: Nested error boundaries at page, feature, and component levels with specific fallback UIs for different error types

## Performance Optimizations

- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component with Supabase Storage integration
- **Code Splitting**: Dynamic imports for heavy components (recipe detail modal, scraping dashboard)
- **Database Indexing**: Composite indexes on recipe title, source, and created_at columns
- **Caching Strategy**: React Query for client-side caching, Next.js cache headers for static assets
- **Bundle Analysis**: Webpack bundle analyzer integration for monitoring package sizes
