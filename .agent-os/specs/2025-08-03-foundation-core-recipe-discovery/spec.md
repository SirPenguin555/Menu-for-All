# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Foundation & Core Recipe Discovery
> Created: 2025-08-03
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Establish the foundational infrastructure for Menu for All by implementing a Next.js application with Supabase integration, user authentication, and basic recipe aggregation functionality that allows users to discover and view recipes from multiple sources with fundamental filtering capabilities.

## User Stories

### Recipe Discovery for Busy Families

As a busy parent, I want to quickly browse recipes from multiple sources in one place, so that I can find meal ideas without having to visit multiple websites and save time on meal planning.

**Detailed Workflow:** User visits the Menu for All platform, browses a paginated list of recipes aggregated from multiple trusted sources, clicks on recipes of interest to view detailed information including ingredients, instructions, and source attribution. The system provides a clean, fast interface that works well on both mobile and desktop devices.

### Secure Account Management

As a health-conscious individual with dietary restrictions, I want to create a secure account, so that I can save my preferences and favorite recipes for future meal planning sessions.

**Detailed Workflow:** User navigates to registration page, creates account with email and password through Supabase authentication, confirms email if required, logs in securely, and accesses personalized features like recipe saving and profile management.

### Recipe Information Access

As a home cooking enthusiast, I want to view complete recipe details including ingredients, instructions, and cooking time, so that I can evaluate whether a recipe fits my skill level and available time.

**Detailed Workflow:** User clicks on a recipe from the listing page, views a detailed recipe page with comprehensive information including ingredient list, step-by-step instructions, cooking/prep time, serving information, and source attribution with proper linking back to original recipe.

## Spec Scope

1. **Next.js Application Setup** - Configure TypeScript-enabled Next.js 14+ application with App Router and development tooling
2. **Supabase Integration** - Set up Supabase project with authentication, database, and client-side integration
3. **User Authentication System** - Implement secure registration, login, logout, and session management
4. **Recipe Data Model** - Design and implement PostgreSQL schema for storing recipe data with proper indexing
5. **Recipe Scraping Service** - Build scraping functionality for 2-3 popular recipe websites with data standardization
6. **Recipe Listing Interface** - Create paginated recipe listing page with basic search and responsive design
7. **Recipe Detail Pages** - Implement individual recipe pages with complete recipe information display

## Out of Scope

- Advanced filtering by dietary restrictions (Phase 2)
- Pantry integration and ingredient matching (Phase 3)
- Meal planning functionality (Phase 4)
- Recipe rating and review system
- Social features and recipe sharing
- Advanced search with autocomplete
- Recipe modification or user-generated content
- Integration with external APIs beyond initial recipe sources

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Next.js Application** - Users can visit the deployed application, register accounts, log in securely, and browse recipe listings with working pagination
2. **Recipe Data Population** - Database contains recipes from at least 2-3 different sources with consistent data structure and proper source attribution
3. **Core User Workflows** - Users can complete the registration process, authenticate securely, view recipe listings, click through to detailed recipe pages, and access all functionality on mobile and desktop devices
