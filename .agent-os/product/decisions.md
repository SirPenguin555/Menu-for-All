## 2025-08-03: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Menu for All will be a recipe aggregation service focused on intelligent filtering capabilities, specifically targeting users with dietary restrictions and those wanting to maximize pantry ingredient usage. The platform will aggregate recipes from multiple internet sources while providing advanced filtering for dietary needs and available ingredients.

### Context

The recipe discovery market is saturated with single-source platforms and basic search functionality. Users with dietary restrictions face significant challenges finding suitable recipes, and food waste from unused pantry ingredients is a common problem. There's an opportunity to create a more intelligent recipe platform that solves both discovery and practical cooking challenges.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Single Recipe Source Platform**
   - Pros: Simpler content management, consistent recipe format, easier to maintain
   - Cons: Limited recipe variety, dependency on single source, less comprehensive coverage

2. **Social Recipe Sharing Platform**
   - Pros: User-generated content, community engagement, scalable content
   - Cons: Quality control challenges, slower initial content growth, moderation overhead

3. **AI-Generated Recipe Platform**
   - Pros: Unlimited recipe possibilities, personalization potential, unique content
   - Cons: Recipe quality uncertainty, complex AI infrastructure, user trust issues

### Rationale

The aggregation approach provides the best balance of comprehensive recipe coverage and practical utility. By focusing on intelligent filtering rather than content creation, we can deliver immediate value while building a sustainable technical foundation. The combination of dietary filtering and pantry matching addresses two distinct but related user pain points that existing platforms don't solve well together.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Comprehensive recipe coverage from day one
- Clear differentiation from existing platforms  
- Addresses real user pain points with practical solutions
- Scalable content model without content creation overhead
- Multiple user personas can find value in the platform

**Negative:**
- Dependency on external recipe sources and their availability
- Potential legal and ethical considerations with content aggregation
- Complex data standardization required across multiple sources
- Need for robust content parsing and quality assurance systems
