## 2025-08-03: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Menu for All will be a recipe aggregation service focused on intelligent filtering capabilities, specifically targeting users with dietary restrictions and those wanting to maximize pantry ingredient usage. The platform will aggregate recipes from multiple internet sources while providing advanced filtering for dietary needs and available ingredients.

### Context

The recipe discovery market is saturated with single-source platforms and basic search functionality. Users with dietary restrictions face significant challenges finding suitable recipes, and food waste from unused pantry ingredients is a common problem. There's an opportunity to create a more intelligent recipe platform that solves both discovery and practical cooking challenges.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Single Recipe Source Platform**
   - Pros: Simpler content management, consistent recipe format, easier to maintain
   - Cons: Limited recipe variety, dependency on single source, less comprehensive coverage

2. **Social Recipe Sharing Platform**
   - Pros: User-generated content, community engagement, scalable content
   - Cons: Quality control challenges, slower initial content growth, moderation overhead

3. **AI-Generated Recipe Platform**
   - Pros: Unlimited recipe possibilities, personalization potential, unique content
   - Cons: Recipe quality uncertainty, complex AI infrastructure, user trust issues

### Rationale

The aggregation approach provides the best balance of comprehensive recipe coverage and practical utility. By focusing on intelligent filtering rather than content creation, we can deliver immediate value while building a sustainable technical foundation. The combination of dietary filtering and pantry matching addresses two distinct but related user pain points that existing platforms don't solve well together.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Comprehensive recipe coverage from day one
- Clear differentiation from existing platforms  
- Addresses real user pain points with practical solutions
- Scalable content model without content creation overhead
- Multiple user personas can find value in the platform

**Negative:**
- Dependency on external recipe sources and their availability
- Potential legal and ethical considerations with content aggregation
- Complex data standardization required across multiple sources
- Need for robust content parsing and quality assurance systems

## 2025-08-08: Authentication System Architecture

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Implement a comprehensive authentication system using Supabase Auth with Next.js API routes, React Context for state management, and form-based UI components with proper validation and error handling.

### Context

The application requires user authentication to enable personalized features like recipe saving, meal planning, and pantry management. The authentication system needs to be secure, user-friendly, and integrate seamlessly with the existing Supabase infrastructure.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **NextAuth.js with Multiple Providers**
   - Pros: Multiple OAuth providers, well-established library, flexible configuration
   - Cons: Additional complexity, potential conflicts with Supabase, separate session management

2. **Direct Supabase Auth Client-Side Only**
   - Pros: Simpler implementation, fewer API routes, direct integration
   - Cons: Less control over auth flow, limited server-side validation, security concerns

3. **Custom JWT Implementation**
   - Pros: Full control over authentication logic, customizable token structure
   - Cons: Security complexity, maintenance overhead, reinventing established patterns

### Implementation Details

- **API Layer:** Next.js API routes (`/api/auth/*`) for server-side auth operations
- **Client State:** React Context (`AuthContext`) for global authentication state management
- **UI Components:** Reusable forms (`LoginForm`, `RegisterForm`) with Zod validation
- **Route Protection:** `ProtectedRoute` and `GuestOnlyRoute` components for access control
- **Session Management:** Custom `useSession` hook with automatic token refresh
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error states and user-friendly messaging

### Rationale

This architecture provides the optimal balance of security, user experience, and maintainability. By using Supabase Auth as the foundation while adding custom API routes, we get enterprise-grade security with full control over the user experience. The component-based approach ensures consistency and reusability across the application.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Secure, production-ready authentication system
- Seamless integration with existing Supabase infrastructure
- Reusable components for consistent UX across the application
- Comprehensive test coverage for reliability
- Server-side validation and error handling for security
- Flexible architecture that can accommodate future auth requirements

**Negative:**
- Additional API routes increase deployment complexity
- React Context adds some client-side state management overhead
- Form validation logic requires maintenance as requirements evolve
